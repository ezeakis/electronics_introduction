## Introduction

You are going to learn the science behind how electronics work. This makes everything from lightbulbs, to computers, to the internet work, so it's basically the science behind our modern world!

### Hardware

For the game
+ 1 rope, or a roll of tape to lay out a line on the floor
+ 1 chair, or another object to create an obstruction on the line

+ 1 chair, table, or other platform on which to place the lightweight object

For the circuit
+ 1 breadboard
+ 1 battery case with two AA or AAA batteries
+ 1 LED
+ 1 100/220/330 Ohm resistor
