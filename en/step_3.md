## Game of Electrons

This game will help participants understand how electrons behave in an electronic circuit.

### Setup

 1. One participant will act as the 'battery', standing with their feet apart and staying in the same spot throughout the game.

 2. The 'battery' participant stands opposite a table, upon which a lightweight object (e.g. a pencil) is placed.

 3. Use rope, or tape, to create a 'circuit' that starts at one of the 'battery' participant's feet, forms a loop which passes near the table, and continues on to the 'battery' participant's other foot.

### Play

 1. The remaining participants will act as electrons in this 'circuit'.

 2. The mentor explains how batteries 'push' electrons through circuits, causing them to do work like lighting things up, creating sounds, etc.

 3. Participants form a queue and, as they reach the 'battery' participant, the 'battery' gently pushes them to start them moving through the 'circuit'.

 4. Participants travel along the rope, or tape, until they reach the table. When participants reach the table, they pause and lift the object on the table up and then replace it, before continuing to follow the rope back to the 'battery', who again gives them a gentle push to keep them moving through the 'circuit'.

 5. The mentor explains how the participants lifting the object on the table represents the electrons doing work, like lighting an LED. 

 6. The mentor then discusses how, if they tried to do this too quickly, they might damage the object, just as too much electricity can damage things like an LED, a light bulb, or a speaker.

 7. The mentor then places an obstacle, such as a chair, on the 'circuit' before participants reach the table.

 8. The participants move through the 'circuit' again, with the mentor ensuring that they slow down to pass the obstacle safely.

 9. The mentor points out that moving over, or around, the obstacle will slow the 'electrons' down, and this is what is done in a real circuit using a component called a 'resistor'.
