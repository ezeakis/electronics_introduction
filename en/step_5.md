## An LED circuit

From the game we learned: 

+ how electrons travel through wires
+ what a battery does
+ how electrons light an LED
+ what a resistor is used for

So, if we connect a battery to the two ends of a wire, then the electrons will begin to flow. If we use this movement effectively we can do a lot of things. You're going to create an example using an LED.

You will use a breadboard, which helps and connect position electronic components without the need to create permanent joins between them.

Lines on a breadboard are like small wires. Placing two components on the same line is like connecting them with a wire.

Here is a diagram of the circuit you will create. You can use a 100 Ohm resistor. Close resistance values (like 220 or 330 Ohm) are also appropriate.

Electrons begin from the one end of the battery, pass through the wire, to the resistor, then into the LED where they light it up before flowing through the wire and back into the other end of the battery, starting over again.

We can observe that electrons leave the battery, they return to it, and they leave it again. We will never meet a functioning circuit without a closed loop.

Assemble the circuit and see the LED light up!
