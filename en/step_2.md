## Electrons

Electrons are **incredibly** tiny particles. To get some idea of how small, imagine taking all the water in the world and pouring it into regular sized drinking glasses. Once you had used up every drop of water, you'd still only have one tenth as many glasses of water as there are electrons in a single grain of table salt!

Electrons are part of atoms â€” the tiny particles of matter that make up everything in the universe. In the following image(*) you can see how the electrons form part of an atom of Magnesium.

What we call 'electricity' is just moving electrons around. All electronic devices work this way, and so do the nerves in your body that let you move your hand, or see these words in front of you. Electrons move very fast, which is why you don't see a delay when you switch on a light, and why computers can do complicated things so quickly!

Electrons need a path to move through and, just like water, they will usually take the path that is easiest for them. Where it's available, this is a path through metal, so we use wires for this reason. These wires are usually covered in a material the electrons find it hard to move through, like plastic, to protect us from shocking ourselves.

To push the electrons in a wire we need to use voltage. We can get voltage from a battery. The more volts a battery has, the more powerful it is and the harder it can push the electrons.

In the next step we will play a game in order to understand what is happening with the electrons.
